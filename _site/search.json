Welcome to my GitHub profile!\nI have a background in mechanical engineering, which gives me a unique perspective on every job. When I worked as a production engineer, I was able to keep an eye on day-to-day operations in the industry and make sure that clients got their orders on time. Coding helps me bring my thoughts to life. I enjoy the creative process of fixing problems and making things that matter, whether it‚Äôs testing new technologies, building scalable web apps, or diving into data analysis.\nIt‚Äôs always my goal to find new tools and frameworks to use. I‚Äôm currently learning about machine learning, and I‚Äôm excited about what it can do.\nWhen I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me playing cricket, watching Netflix, or surfing the internet. I believe in a good work-life balance and enjoy spending time with family and friends.\nFeel free to reach out to me at Tejaskumarpatel@my.unt.edu if you want to collaborate, discuss ideas, or just chat about tech. I‚Äôm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals!\nEducation:\nM.S.
