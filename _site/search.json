Welcome to my GitHub profile!\nI have a background in mechanical engineering, which gives me a unique perspective on every job. When I worked as a production engineer, I was able to keep an eye on day-to-day operations in the industry and make sure that clients got their orders on time. Coding helps me bring my thoughts to life. I enjoy the creative process of fixing problems and making things that matter, whether itâ€™s testing new technologies, building scalable web apps, or diving into data analysis.\nItâ€™s always my goal to find new tools and frameworks to use. Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning, and Iâ€™m excited about what it can do.\nWhen Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing cricket, watching Netflix, or surfing the internet. I believe in a good work-life balance and enjoy spending time with family and friends.\nFeel free to reach out to me at pateltejas215@gmail.com if you want to collaborate, discuss ideas, or just chat about tech.

Income100K.150K: This variable represents the percentage or number of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of $100,000 to $150,000.\n14. Income75K.100K: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of $75,000 to $100,000.\n15. Income50K.75K: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of $50,000 to $75,000.\n16. Income35K.50K: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of $35,000 to $50,000.\n17. Income25K.35K: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of $25,000 to $35,000.\n18. PovertyRate: This variable represents the poverty rate in each state, indicating the percentage of the population living below the poverty line or threshold.\nHere, my target variable is commuters\n\n# Create a copy of mydata and call it dataUS\ndataUS &lt;- mydata\n\n# Calculate the commuters variable\ndataUS$commuters &lt;- 100 * dataUS$CommutePublicTransport / dataUS$TotalPopulation\n\n# Remove the CommutePublicTransport and TotalPopulation variables\ndataUS &lt;- dataUS[, !(names(dataUS) %in% c(\"CommutePublicTransport\", \"TotalPopulation\"))]\n\n# Identify the three states with the highest values of commuters\ntop_states &lt;- dataUS[order(dataUS$commuters,decreasing = TRUE), ][1:3, \"State\"]\n\n# Identify the three states with the lowest values of commuters\nbottom_states &lt;- dataUS[order(dataUS$commuters), ][1:3, \"State\"]\n\n# Print the results\ncat(\"Three states with the highest values of commuters:\", top_states, \"\\n\")\n\nThree states with the highest values of commuters: District of Columbia New York New Jersey \n\n\nTask 2:\nHere, I will Generate a scatter plot.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Remove the 'State' column\ndataUS &lt;- select(dataUS, -State)\n\n# Calculate correlations\ncorrelations &lt;- cor(dataUS, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n# Create a dataframe with correlations with 'commuters'\ncor_with_commuters &lt;- data.frame(Variable = row.names(correlations), Correlation = correlations[, \"commuters\"])\n\n# Sort by absolute correlation values\ncor_with_commuters &lt;- cor_with_commuters[order(abs(cor_with_commuters$Correlation), decreasing = TRUE), ]\n\n# Get the variable with the highest absolute correlation\nhighest_corr_var &lt;- cor_with_commuters$Variable[1]\n\n# Generate the scatter plot\nggplot(dataUS, aes_string(x = highest_corr_var, y = \"commuters\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = OwnComputer &lt; 88)) +\n  labs(x = highest_corr_var, y = \"Commuters\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"OwnComputer &lt; 88\")\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nâ„¹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nâ„¹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3:\nHere, I will Create a scatterplot that displays the relationship between residuals and fitted values.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Assuming your dataset is named 'dataUS', replace with your actual dataset name\n# Fit the linear regression model with specified predictors\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(commuters ~ MedianAge + Income100K.150K + Income35K.50K + PovertyRate, data = dataUS)\n\n# Interpretation of coefficient estimates excluding the intercept\ncoef_summary &lt;- summary(model1)$coefficients\ninterpretations &lt;- paste(\n  \"MedianAge:\", round(coef_summary[\"MedianAge\", \"Estimate\"], 4),\n  \"Income100K.150K:\", round(coef_summary[\"Income100K.150K\", \"Estimate\"], 4),\n  \"Income35K.50K:\", round(coef_summary[\"Income35K.50K\", \"Estimate\"], 4),\n  \"PovertyRate:\", round(coef_summary[\"PovertyRate\", \"Estimate\"], 4)\n)\n\n# Print one-sentence interpretations\ninterpretations\n\n[1] \"MedianAge: -0.8853 Income100K.150K: -4.5123 Income35K.50K: -6.2855 PovertyRate: -1.8438\"\n\n# Create a scatterplot of residuals vs. fitted values\nresidual_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(Fitted = fitted(model1), Residuals = residuals(model1)), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(x = \"Fitted Values\", y = \"Residuals\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Residuals vs. Fitted Values\")\n\n# Display the scatterplot\nprint(residual_plot)"
