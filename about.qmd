Welcome

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tejaskumar Patel a passionate Data analyst based in Allen, TX. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have a background in mechanical engineering, which gives me a unique perspective on every job. When I worked as a production engineer, I was able to keep an eye on day-to-day operations in the industry and make sure that clients got their orders on time. Coding helps me bring my thoughts to life. I enjoy the creative process of fixing problems and making things that matter, whether it's testing new technologies, building scalable web apps, or diving into data analysis.

It's always my goal to find new tools and frameworks to use. I'm currently learning about machine learning, and I'm excited about what it can do.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cricket, watching Netflix, or surfing the internet. I believe in a good work-life balance and enjoy spending time with family and friends.

Feel free to reach out to me at [Tejaskumarpatel\@my.unt.edu](mailto:Tejaskumarpatel@my.unt.edu) if you want to collaborate, discuss ideas, or just chat about tech. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals!
