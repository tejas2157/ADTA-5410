Hi, Let's run a regression.

#### **Data Set Description**

## **State-level Census data**

We have state level census data on various socio-economic and demographic factors called **mydata**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

mydata <-read.csv("D://ADTA 5410 DEPLOYMENT//Portfolio//my portfolio//ADTATEJAS//posts//my first post//my portfolio data.csv", head=T)

names(mydata)

```

**Task 1:**

In this task, I will start by looking closely at the data to understand it better. Then, I \'ll use a multiple linear regression to make predictions.

There are 52 observations and 18 variables in the data.

1\. **State**: This variable represents the name of each state in the dataset.

2.**OwnComputer**: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state that own a computer, indicating the level of computer ownership.

3. **CommutePublicTransport**: This variable represents the percentage of people in each state who use public transportation as their primary means of commuting to work or other places.

4.**TotalPopulation**: This variable represents the total population of each state, indicating the number of people residing in that state.

5.**MedianAge**: This variable represents the median age of the population in each state, providing an insight into the state\'s demographic age distribution.

6.**WithCashAssistanceIncome**: This variable represents the percentage of households or individuals in each state receiving cash assistance income, possibly from government programs.

7.**MeanSocialSecurityIncome**: This variable represents the average or mean amount of Social Security income received by individuals in each state.

8\. **SupplementarySecurityIncome**: This variable represent the percentage of people in each state who receives supplementary security income related to social welfare programs.

9\. **WhiteOnly**: This variable represents the percentage of people in each state identifying as White or Caucasian in terms of racial or ethnic background.

10\. **Latinos**: This variable represents the percentage of people in each state identifying as Latino or Hispanic in terms of racial or ethnic background.

11\. **Asians**: This variable represents the percentage of people in each state identifying as Asian in terms of racial or ethnic background.

12\. **AfricanAmerican**: This variable represents the percentage of people in each state identifying as African American or Black in terms of racial or ethnic background.

13\. **Income100K.150K**: This variable represents the percentage or number of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of \$100,000 to \$150,000.

14\. **Income75K.100K**: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of \$75,000 to \$100,000.

15\. **Income50K.75K**: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of \$50,000 to \$75,000.

16\. **Income35K.50K**: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of \$35,000 to \$50,000.

17\. **Income25K.35K**: This variable represents the percentage of households in each state with an annual income falling within the range of \$25,000 to \$35,000.

18\. **PovertyRate**: This variable represents the poverty rate in each state, indicating the percentage of the population living below the poverty line or threshold.

Here, my target variable is commuters

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Create a copy of mydata and call it dataUS
dataUS <- mydata

# Calculate the commuters variable
dataUS$commuters <- 100 * dataUS$CommutePublicTransport / dataUS$TotalPopulation

# Remove the CommutePublicTransport and TotalPopulation variables
dataUS <- dataUS[, !(names(dataUS) %in% c("CommutePublicTransport", "TotalPopulation"))]

# Identify the three states with the highest values of commuters
top_states <- dataUS[order(dataUS$commuters,decreasing = TRUE), ][1:3, "State"]

# Identify the three states with the lowest values of commuters
bottom_states <- dataUS[order(dataUS$commuters), ][1:3, "State"]

# Print the results
cat("Three states with the highest values of commuters:", top_states, "\n")
```

**Task 2:**

Here, I will Generate a scatter plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Remove the 'State' column
dataUS <- select(dataUS, -State)

# Calculate correlations
correlations <- cor(dataUS, use = "complete.obs")

# Create a dataframe with correlations with 'commuters'
cor_with_commuters <- data.frame(Variable = row.names(correlations), Correlation = correlations[, "commuters"])

# Sort by absolute correlation values
cor_with_commuters <- cor_with_commuters[order(abs(cor_with_commuters$Correlation), decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Get the variable with the highest absolute correlation
highest_corr_var <- cor_with_commuters$Variable[1]

# Generate the scatter plot
ggplot(dataUS, aes_string(x = highest_corr_var, y = "commuters")) +
  geom_point(aes(color = OwnComputer < 88)) +
  labs(x = highest_corr_var, y = "Commuters") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "OwnComputer < 88")

```

**Task 3:**

Here, I will Create a scatterplot that displays the relationship between residuals and fitted values.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your dataset is named 'dataUS', replace with your actual dataset name
# Fit the linear regression model with specified predictors
model1 <- lm(commuters ~ MedianAge + Income100K.150K + Income35K.50K + PovertyRate, data = dataUS)

# Interpretation of coefficient estimates excluding the intercept
coef_summary <- summary(model1)$coefficients
interpretations <- paste(
  "MedianAge:", round(coef_summary["MedianAge", "Estimate"], 4),
  "Income100K.150K:", round(coef_summary["Income100K.150K", "Estimate"], 4),
  "Income35K.50K:", round(coef_summary["Income35K.50K", "Estimate"], 4),
  "PovertyRate:", round(coef_summary["PovertyRate", "Estimate"], 4)
)

# Print one-sentence interpretations
interpretations

# Create a scatterplot of residuals vs. fitted values
residual_plot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(Fitted = fitted(model1), Residuals = residuals(model1)), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs. Fitted Values")

# Display the scatterplot
print(residual_plot)

```
